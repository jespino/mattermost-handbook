# Public Speaking

In Mattermost, we encourage public speaking at any level, from small meetups to big international conferences. The DevRel team can help you with public speaking. To contact the DevRel team, enter the DevRel channel in the Mattermost server.

## How to get started

We recommend contacting the DevRel team if you are interested in public speaking. We will help you start with small meetups in your city or region or go big upfront. However, you prefer. To find small meetups, we recommend you check meetups in [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/). For more prominent conferences, you can check sites like [Papercall](https://www.papercall.io/), [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/), or [Developers Events](https://developers.events/).

Another common problem that starters face is selecting the topic and preparing the CFP (Call For Papers). We can help you with that. Contact us, and we will brainstorm to find the best topic for you and prepare the CFP.

Once you have the CFP prepared, you need to prepare your slides; we can help you with that, too. We can review your slides, give you feedback, or even have a pairing session to prepare the content.

After preparing your slides, you have multiple options for rehearsing your talk. You can do it in front of some of the DevVel team or front of the company as part of the DevMeeting.

Finally, whenever you get selected and have to go to the conference/meetup, we can provide you with the help you need. We can help you book the hotel and the trip (if required), and the company will cover the cost (if the conference does not cover it).

## How to select the event

When selecting the event you want to apply for, you need to consider the following rule: the bigger/more relevant the event, the farther you can go. Let's see some examples:

  We encourage you to apply to as many small events as you want in your city or region (when no flight/hotel is needed). For example, The GoMad if you live near Madrid or DevFests near you.
  We encourage you to apply to any medium/big event in your country. Anything with over 300 attendees can be considered a medium/big event. For example, in Spain, something like Codemotion or Commit Conf could be viewed as a medium/big event.
  We encourage you to apply to any big/relevant event internationally. Anything with over 1000 attendees or that is a reference in the industry can be considered a big/relevant event, such as GopherCon, PgEurope, or Fosdem.
  - If the event covers the cost of the flight and the hotel, you can go as far as you want, no matter the size of the conference.

Also, in terms of the theme of the conferences, we focus our efforts on conferences related to Mattermost objective (mission-critical work) or technologies that we use. For instance, conferences about cybersecurity, DevOps, AI, Go, Postgres, and Kubernetes are all good options; Java or Ruby events would not be. More generalistic conferences that include relevant topics are also good.

Ask the DevRel team if you are unsure if the event is big/relevant enough.

## Requirements about the content

In Mattermost, we don't have any restrictions about the content of the talks; you can talk about whatever you want (always being respectful). However, we encourage you to talk about the great things we do at Mattermost. Also, we encourage you to mention Mattermost during the introduction of the talk, for example, "My name is XXX, and I'm YYY at Mattermost; for whoever doesn't know, Mattermost is a communication platform for Mission Critical Infrastructure."

When you are talking at a conference, you are still representing Mattermost to a certain degree, so we expect you to be respectful and professional no matter the topic that you are talking about. Also, we expect you not to share any data that can be considered private during the conferences and, of course, follow the "Code of Conduct" of the conference.
